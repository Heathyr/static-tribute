                <h4>In Her Own Words</h4>
                <p>“As soon as I heard about the drag shows opening there I said ‘bye bye men’s clothes’. I’ve never put anything on since. Never.”</p>
                <p>"The police were very, very heavy... They used to take us into the police station and give us a hiding and beat us up. I was locked up... about a dozen times. But it made me a stronger person today."</p>
                <p>"All the straight people in that time, when they would hear about these gay places, they said it wouldn't last long... Fifty years later they're still going. And all those straight clubs and straight owners who laughed at us, they're all dead and gone and we're still here."</p>

              <div class="half-width">
                <h4>In the Words of Others</h4>
                <p>“Carmen Rupe was an icon for Sydney's Transgender community and a tireless advocate for GLBT rights. She was a quiet achiever who spent decades as a volunteer with many organisations who provided support to some of our city's most vulnerable people.” ------------------------------ <span class="bold"> Sydney Mayor, Clover Moore</span></p>
                <p>“I admired her strength in living her life on her terms and standing up against discrimination.” ------------------------------ <span class="bold"> Wellington Mayor, Celia Wade-Brown</span></p>
                <p>“She was put on this earth with the sole mission to pave the way for so many... and that is just what she has done.” --------- <span class="bold"> Former Councilor Jacquie Grant</span></p>
